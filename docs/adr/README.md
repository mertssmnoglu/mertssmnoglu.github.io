# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

- Date Format: DD.MM.YYYY
- Statuses: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated

Since it's a personal static site all ADRs are expected to be accepted,
but they are still documented for future reference and
to maintain a clear record of decisions made during the development process.
