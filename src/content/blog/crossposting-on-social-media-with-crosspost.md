## My Social Media Journey

I'm using Bluesky, Mastodon and Twitter(X) for content sharing.
These platforms are both text based and has different character limits.
I prefer using hashtags on Bluesky and Mastodon,
but due to character limits I don't prefer using hashtags inside Twitter.
I think Twitter(X) people do not care about hashtags,
but Bluesky and Mastodon has a different audience.
When I want to share something I need to open 3 different browser tabs
and it takes time.

I'm also using LinkedIn but I have a separate strategy for it.
It has more character limits and a different audience compared to the other platforms
so I can share more detailed content there without worrying about the character count.

## Why Use crosspost?

I need something that can help me to share my content across multiple platforms
without the hassle of posting separately.
I don't want to waste my time with
3 times of post configuration and 3 times of sharing it.
One time configuration and 1 time posting is what i need.
First, i tried [MixPost][mixpost-website], but it takes so much time to configure.
Simple and effective tools are so important for my workflow.

Thanks to [Arda Kılıçdağı][arda-kilicdagi-mastodon] I discovered [crosspost][crosspost-github].

It s a great tool developed by [Nicholas C. Zakas][nicholas-zakas-github]
for posting across multiple social networks at once.
You can use it via JavaScript Code, CLI or MCP Server.

## Pre-requisites

You need to have [Node.js][nodejs-website] installed on your machine.

## CLI Usage

First of all, I suggest you to create a new directory called `crosspost`
to hold your secrets and configurations.

```shell
mkdir crosspost
cd crosspost
```

Save your credentials inside `.env`.

Please get required credentials for each social media platform you want to post to.
Instructions can be found in the [crosspost strategy documentation][crosspost-strategy-docs].

```env
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
TWITTER_API_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWITTER_API_CONSUMER_SECRET=

MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=
MASTODON_HOST=

BLUESKY_HOST=
BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER=
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=

LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=

DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=

DEVTO_API_KEY=

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=

SLACK_TOKEN=
SLACK_CHANNEL=
```

Install `crosspost` as a global package.

```shell
npm install --global @humanwhocodes/crosspost
```

I will recommend you to create a {topic}.txt file to hold your post content.

```shell
echo "My blog post content" > my_blog_post.txt
```

Share your post on Mastodon

```shell
CROSSPOST_DOTENV=.env crosspost -m --file my_blog_post.txt
```

Share your post on Mastodon, Bluesky and Twitter

```shell
CROSSPOST_DOTENV=.env crosspost -m -b -t --file my_blog_post.txt
```

## Conclusion
